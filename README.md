# Calculator project #

Link to project demo: https://josephthomasoldfield.github.io/Calculator/

This project uses *react*, *html*, *css*, and *node*. I use these technologies to crreate a react based calculator as one of my first react projects. I enjoyed working on this project and it helped me to finally understand flexbox. 

## Features

- Use of Math.JS to calculate equations. 
- Passed props and used navLoader Efficientley to create the calculator.
- support for both mobile and desktop with flexbox

## Improvements

- Hover functionality could be added for cleaner look.
- functionality for more complex functions such as SquareRoot / PowerOf.
